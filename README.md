# Real estate sunlight evaluator #
Calculate the amount of natural sunlight coming into a house through its windows, to know if it's nice to live inside it.
The library also supports consideration of shadowing by buildings and other obstacles.

If you use this library for whatever purpose, please let me know so I may link back or refer to your projects.
